                        Being part of a community was something I always wanted to be. Due to COVID-19, I was unable to spend most of my time at UCF in person.
                        I missed so many opportunities, events, and memories. Since I had the opportunity to spend my year on campus, I tried to make the most of it.
                        From volunteering and participating in club events, I created new and wonderful memories of citizenship here at UCF.

                                My passion for dogs led me to STEP @ UCF, a service dog training program dedicated to growing service dogs that will one day help someone
                                with a disability. This experience wasi nsightful, not only because I got to learn about those with disabilities and the laws pertaining to 
                                service dogs, but also because I learned how to communicate and network.

                                One other activity I love to do when I get the chance, is to volunteer for a good cause. There are many opportunities out there that you can participate in to make
                                someone else's life better for just a few hours of your time. I think volunteering is a fufilling activity and try to incoporate more often into my life. Inspirational Boards with MS
                                was a very heart-filled volunteer experience. During this event, I made inspirational cards for those suffering with Multiple Sclerosis. Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic disease
                                that affects the central nervous system. It was a pleasure making inspirational cards for a group of individuals whose strength is unmeasured.
