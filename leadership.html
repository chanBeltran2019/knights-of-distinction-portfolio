                        I never thought I was the leadership type. I used to always follow behind the footsteps of other people, too afraid that if I did 
                        things my way I would do it wrong. However, through this journey of self-growth and going out of my comfort zone, I learned that everyone
                        has the capability to be a leader. No one is born a leader, leaders are made. Through joining the National Society of Leadership and Success as well
                        as joining the Retention and Intervention team, soon I was learning how to be the leader I always wanted to be.

                            <p class = "fs-4 lh-md text-black"> January of 2021, I recieved the opportunity to join the National Society of Leadership and Success due to my 
                                excellence at UCF. I was excited for this opportunity as I always wanted to have the ability to be a leader, but felt as though I lacked the characteristics too.
                                NSLS helped me see past that lie I told myself and showed me that everyone can be a leader, no matter what type of personality you have. Through taking 
                                self-assessments and completing activities on learning how to become a leader, I learned that everyone has a different leadership style. Not all 
                                leaderers are the same, nor lead the same way. This comforted me and made me realize I had just as much potential as anybody to be a leader.

                                as a hard feat to accomplish, I realize that not everyone else gets the same opportunity to learn how to become a leader and for that I am ever grateful.
                                Due to NSLS, I feel ready to step-up and lead other people when it is time for a leader to rise.

                            In October of 2021, I recieved the opportunity to take a student leadership role as part of UCF's Student Rentention and Intervention Team.
                            The Retention Intervention Team is comprised of students, faculty, advisors, and administration who serve to find and unblock barriers for students who are enrolling in colleges.
                            Our goal is to figure out what barriers there are to potential students that impede them from enrolling and we try to find ways can we supersede these barriers. As a student leader,
                            I am the voice for students who cannot share their's and give my input to the administration on what reasons I think are keeping students from graduating college.
                            Through this experience, I have learned the value of my voice, to speak up, and to not be intimidated by those who are older than me when we are in the same level of authority.
